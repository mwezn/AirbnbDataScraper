# AirbnbDataScraper
This is my personal project which im slowly building to help understand short term rental insights for several cities in the UK via the Airbnb platform. 
Its written in Javascript, Node.js & uses Google Maps API. I intend to create a fullstack version in React soon.
Ive included my own Google Maps API key in the .html file situated in the Client folder. 
This project is also dependent on the amazing repo found at https://github.com/googlearchive/js-info-bubble 
which I rely on to customise the popup CSS tabs on the Google map markers.

To download this & run the code from your own computer (or edit it) install Git & Node.js on your system & then do the following:

1. ```git clone https://github.com/mwezn/AirbnbDataScraper.git ```
2. Change to the local (cloned) directory ```cd AirbnbDataScraper```
3. install packages ```npm install```
4. run the server file ```node index.js```
5.Open your internet browser and navigate to ```http://localhost:3050```
